# BatchFlow
### Own your flow

A personal zero-based budgeting web app. Plan income and expenses by category, log transactions, and track spending in real time — backed by Supabase with per-user auth and deployed on Vercel. Installable as a PWA on iOS and Android.

---

## Features

- **Zero-based budgeting** — assign every dollar of income to a category; the unbudgeted remainder is always visible
- **Month navigation** — each month has its own independent budget plan and transaction set; navigate freely with a Today button to jump back to the current month
- **New-month copy experience** — arriving at a month with no budget prompts you to copy amounts from an adjacent month or start fresh
- **Budget planning** — set planned amounts at the category or subcategory level with inline editing; category totals roll up automatically from subcategory values
- **Dashboard** — planned vs. actual vs. remaining for every category, color-coded progress bars, and a recent activity panel
- **Transaction logging** — record transactions with amount, date, category, subcategory, merchant, and notes
- **Split transactions** — split a single transaction across multiple categories and subcategories (e.g. a shopping trip covering groceries and clothing)
- **Quick transaction entry** — floating action button on the Dashboard and Transactions pages opens the transaction form without navigating away
- **Category management** — add, rename (inline double-click), reorder (arrow buttons), and delete income and expense categories
- **Subcategory management** — add, rename (inline double-click), drag-and-drop reorder, and delete; renaming from the Budget page is also supported and syncs everywhere
- **Analytics** — pie chart category breakdown, monthly spending bar chart, and income vs. expense line chart across recent months
- **Settings** — install prompt for PWA, account info, preferences (currency, week start, default page), JSON data export and import for full backup and restore
- **PWA** — installable on iOS and Android directly from the browser; app shell and static assets are cached for offline use; Supabase API calls use a network-first strategy
- **Multi-user auth** — email/password sign in and sign up via Supabase; every user's data is fully isolated at the database level via Postgres row-level security

## Running Locally

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/budget-tool.git
cd budget-tool
npm install
```

### 2. Set environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

Both values are in your Supabase project under **Settings → API**.

### 3. Start the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start dev server at http://localhost:5173 |
| `npm run build` | Production build |
| `npm run preview` | Preview the production build locally |

## Deploying to Vercel

1. Push the repository to GitHub
2. Import the repo in the [Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com/new)
3. Add `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` under **Settings → Environment Variables**
4. Deploy — Vercel detects Vite automatically; no custom build settings required

Every subsequent push to `main` triggers a new production deployment automatically.

## Database Schema

All data lives in Supabase (Postgres). Every table has a `user_id` column; RLS policies ensure users can only access their own rows.

```
categories         — id, user_id, name, type ('income'|'expense'), color, sort_order
subcategories      — id, category_id, user_id, name, sort_order
transactions       — id, user_id, date, amount, type, merchant, notes, is_split, category_id, subcategory_id
transaction_splits — id, transaction_id, category_id, subcategory_id, amount
budget_plans       — id, user_id, month_key (YYYY-MM), category_id, subcategory_id, planned_amount
```

Cascade deletes: removing a category removes its subcategories and budget plans; removing a transaction removes its splits; removing a subcategory removes its budget plans.
